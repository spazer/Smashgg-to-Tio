# Smashgg-to-Tio
Converts a smash.gg bracket into a .tio file (XML)

This program pulls data from the smash.gg website via their API. It then writes relevant data into a .tio file. 

Note that this .tio file is not a full implementation. It is intended for use with SkillKeeper and will likely crash Tio if you try to open it there.
